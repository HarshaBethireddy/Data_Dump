make the logs to low level & restart the services (depending on environments)

FSR -> ACQ, CLI Files (Input Requests)
Prequal Requests

Will share above two, unzip and place it in the pack
Before starting Batch running we need to clear the JSON files

Appids updated in requests and all are placed in JSON files folder, so we have to before hand clear this JSON files folder

Before starting open apiconfig sheet and check we gave correct host (ip addr) - web server not app server's [API URL, HostName]

PreTestRunner.bat [No need to update] - ACQ, CLI (MasterTestData Sheet), Prequel Master TestData Sheet

It will store the responses automatically in TestResponse folder, it will generate a folder with runid (will have all responses for all our requests)

We can check responses - 19202 error [BPS Timeout], 19203 (for some we can validate later), if for all like that only we need to stop [depending on size of file] [ACQ 20KB, CLI 2KB, PRQ 7KB]

Next deploy based on Iplan document

Before post run -> go to SOAP req, trigger 1 appln -> Search that appln in UI and in audit trails check if the release version modified to our deployed version or not

After Post Batch run same thing

Double click on Comparator -> asks for pre run id and post run id, give them 

In compare results folder we can see the comparision results [pre run id vs post run id]

After that we have CSV_MERGER.bat
Enter the subfolder name containing the CSV files:pre run id vs post run id
We can see the results in MergedOut_File folder [folder name with date]
